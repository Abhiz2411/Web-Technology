Welcome to my Web-Technology GitHub repository!

This repository contains a collection of 10 projects that showcase my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. Each project includes a detailed explanation with the link to respective study material that provides a brief overview of the project, as well as information on how to run and test it.

The projects in this repository cover a wide range of topics, including web design, front-end development, and back-end development. Some of the projects include interactive elements such as forms, animations, and dynamic content, while others focus on layout and design.

Whether you're a beginner looking to learn the fundamentals of web development or an experienced developer looking for inspiration and new ideas, you'll find something of interest in this repository. Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy exploring the projects!
